This days the technology is developing at very high speed automation and innovation is in every field and everyone is looking for automation and advancements in all the sectors. The Temperature measurement using atmega328 is capable of maintaining the proper temperature inside the bus. The main role performed by this is to sense the temperature inside the Bus using temperature sensor (LM35) and it will give the signal to fan which will get switched ON and OFF according to requirement.

This switching of fan will be depend on present tempreture at that moment. If there is too cold inside the bus, then the process will go to increase the tempreture up to required mark so that passengers will get that much of comfort in the bus. If there is already high tempreture inside the bus, then it will set to decrease it to make the environment cold., mean to say that the fan will work accordingly.

As like the whole flow will continue and thatâ€™s what the reason we can say that the seat is able to control the tempreture. This measured tempreture will displayed on LCD screen and the main control is in the hand of atmega328.

Features
The System will sense is passenger seated or not.
Passenger has the access to modify the speed of a fan in the bus.
Low cost and robust system.
Modular Approach.
